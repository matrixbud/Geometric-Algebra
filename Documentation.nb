 " //.ruleQ\n\nFYI. Octonions are non-associative and so cannot be \
represented using geometric products.\n\nThere are a few things I wish to \
clarify. First, unlike other GA packages, this package uses standard notation \
for subscripts. It was a LOT of work to program this way, and I was \
discouraged from doing so by several of the Mathematica gurus, but I believe \
it is up to the programmer to make a package friendly for the user rather \
than making the work easy for the programmer.\n\nThe second thing is the \
matter of dimension. Other than computation time, there is no constraint on \
dimension. The odd thing that I wish to point out is that there is no need \
for the user to specify dimension except in rare cases such as the Hodge \
Dual. It might seem that the dimension n would be required input for, say, \
the wedge product of two multivectors (or clifs, as I prefer to call them). \
The message is to not worry about the dimension of your space. Just enter \
your clifs and the operations take care of dimension for you. \n\nA 3rd item \
is that of basis. For vectors, the basis used is clear: ",

the workbook, press \[EnterKey]. The output should be the same as the \
corresponding entry in the right-hand column of the palette. Now modify some \
parameters of the formula you just inputted, say, change the letter a to the \
letter b, or dimension 3 to dimension 4, and press \[EnterKey] again. Next, \
select something from column 2. This generates the same output, but now it is \
provided in the input area for you to use, saving you from having to copy and \
paste the output. Finally, hoover over the commands in both columns to get \
more information. These functions have been provided to hopefully simplify \
typing by providing inputs that you modify rather than having to type all \
inputs from scratch.\n\nThe 4rd section of the palette contains the main \
Geometric Algebra (GA) operations. The Geometric Product can be entered using \
the first command in this section, or by using the \[Diamond] symbol, \
entering from the palette manually typing. Some texts restrict the Geometric \
Product to homogenous multivectors; that is, multivectors whose terms are all \
of the same grade. These texts then discuss \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]extensions\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], or define other terms, to discuss the natural \
extensions of geometric products to non-homogeneous multivectors. This \
Mathematica package simply uses the term Geometric Product to cover products \
of any two (or more) multivectors, whether or not homogeneous.\n\nThe same \
thing goes for Wedge, Dot, and Scalar products and Contractions. The user can \
enter homogeneous or non-homogeneous multivectors. The Wedge Product of 2 \
multivectors is computed by taking the terms of the Geometric Product whose \
grade is the sum of the grades of its factors. That is,\n\n\tA ",

 "\n\nThis package contains only a very basic set of GA operations, but other \
GA operations can easily be built upon them. The geometric product is \
somewhat complicated to program because it must handle antisymmetrization. \
Most GA operations are easy to implement once the geometric product is \
defined. Thus, the benefits of this package are:\n\n   1. It uses natural \
mathematical notation for subscripts and standard wedge and dot symbols, not \
requiring you to learn new notation. (Both geometric product and Mathematica\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s product use a space. To distinguish them, we use a \
diamond for geometrical product.)\n   2. Operations are performed naturally, \
not by converting back and forth to lists (though lists are supported)\n   3. \
The function definitions are generally very short, self-documented, and easy \
to follow, thus easily modified or extended\n   4. The palette greatly \
simplifies typing input, entering sample multivectors that can quickly be \
edited \n   5. Because symbolic coefficients are handled (as well as \
numeric), it is easy to generate generic formulas and to test hypotheses such \
as whether an identity works in dimensions higher than, say, 3 or whether an \
identity can be expanded from vectors to blades or beyond.\n   6. The numeric \
capabilities allow you to instantly carry out computations that would require \
an extensive amount of time and tedium to do manually\n  7. One can quickly \
configure, or switch between, spatial dimensions and space and space-time.\n  \
8. Except for printouts (which can be pages long in higher dimensions) most \
operations compute instantly even in higher dimensions. The definitions are \
written entirely without inefficient \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]for loops\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and other such constructs.\n\nFinally, the author is \
retired and built this package working in a vacuum as a way of teaching \
himself both GA and Mathematica. If you are using this package, consider \
yourself a beta-tester. Let me know of any bugs you find. I might find time \
to correct them. I have thoroughly tested - + + + and somewhat tested + - - - \
Clifford algebras. Contact me at uvw@sbcglobal.net.\n\n\n* You can use the \
notebook as is or else implement a private notebook context. Private cell \
contexts have not been tested but are likely compatible. The issue is that \
the author has had to take great care to manage the context of the symbol e \
used in the basis ",
