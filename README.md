# Geometric-Algebra
Mathematica Package -- A user-friendly geometric-algebra environment in Mathematica: geometric products, wedge products, dot and scalar products, contractions, space-like and time-like rotors, multivector inverses, gorms, Hodge duals, etc. Enter and view equations in standard, easy-to-read mathematical notation utilizing exponents and subscripts, a normally very unfriendly method of operation in Mathematica.
