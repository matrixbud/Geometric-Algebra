# Geometric-Algebra
Mathematica Package -- A user-friendly Clifford-algebra environment in Mathematica: geometric products, wedge (aka exterior) products, dot and scalar products, contractions, space-like and time-like rotors, multivector inverses, gorms, Hodge duals, pseudoscalars, etc. Enter equations and do computations in standard, easy-to-read mathematical notation utilizing exponents and subscripts, a normally very unfriendly and discouraged method of operation in Mathematica.

Currently (Jan, 2021), the Mathematica files seem no longer to be readable in my repository. Also, these files no longer have a download button, although the pdf and other files do. The best and quickest way to view this package is simply to download the entire repository, which is surprisingly quick (one or two seconds to download).  Click the green “Code” button (at the top of the list of files) and click “Download ZIP.”

After installing the package in Mathematica on your computer, the single best file for explaining this package is the Working Tutorial. To install, I suggest you start with the Microsoft Word Read Me First file or the pdf Read Me First file for a short overview of this package. But, you can instead go directly to the Installation Guide, which has instructions for installing the package in your Mathematica environment.

The Quick Start can help you to get going. The Documentation file provides additional pointers. The installation Guide describes what the various files are.
