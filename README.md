# Geometric-Algebra
Mathematica Package -- A user-friendly Clifford-algebra environment in Mathematica: geometric products, wedge (aka exterior) products, dot and scalar products, contractions, space-like and time-like rotors, multivector inverses, gorms, Hodge duals, pseudoscalars, etc. Enter equations and do computations in standard, easy-to-read mathematical notation utilizing exponents and subscripts, a normally very unfriendly and discouraged method of operation in Mathematica.

Currently (Jan, 2021), the Mathematica files seem no longer to be readable in my repository. Also, these files no longer have a download button, although the pdf and other files do. The best and quickest way to view this package is simply to download the entire repository, which is surprisingly quick (one or two seconds to download).  Click the green “Code” button and click “Download ZIP.”

Please start with the Microsoft Word Read Me First file or the pdf Read Me First file for an overview of this package.
Then go to Installation Guide for instructions on installing the package in your Mathematica environment.
Next go to Quick Start to get going,
followed by the main documentation (Working Tutorial), and then Documentation.
The installation Guide explains what the various files are. The Working tutorial provides a hands-on guide to using this package.
