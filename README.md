# Geometric-Algebra
Mathematica Package -- A user-friendly Clifford-algebra environment in Mathematica: geometric products, wedge (aka exterior) products, dot and scalar products, contractions, space-like and time-like rotors, multivector inverses, gorms, Hodge duals, pseudoscalars, etc. Enter equations and do computations in standard, easy-to-read mathematical notation utilizing exponents and subscripts, a normally very unfriendly and discouraged method of operation in Mathematica.

Please start with the Microsoft Word Read Me First file or the pdf Read Me First file for an overview of this package.
Then go to Installation Guide for instructions on installing the package in your Mathematica environment.
Next go to Quick Start to get going,
followed by the main documentation (Working Tutorial), and then Documentation.
The installation Guide explains what the various files are. The Working tutorial provides a hands-on guide to using this package.
